ðŸš€ SQL Data Analysis: Transaction & Sales Insights
Iâ€™m excited to share my recent SQL project, where I analyzed transaction and sales data to uncover valuable business insights. This project involved writing 14 SQL queries to extract key metrics, optimize decision-making, and improve operational efficiency.

ðŸ“Œ Key Highlights:
âœ… Total Sales & Transactions â€“ Identified revenue trends and top-performing products.
âœ… Customer Insights â€“ Ranked top spenders and frequent buyers.
âœ… Pending Payments â€“ Detected unpaid transactions for better financial tracking.
âœ… Stock Monitoring â€“ Flagged low-stock items to avoid shortages.
âœ… Monthly Sales Trends â€“ Tracked seasonal sales fluctuations.
âœ… Best-Selling Categories â€“ Determined which product categories drive revenue.
âœ… Unsold Products â€“ Found products with zero sales for inventory optimization.

ðŸ’¡ Challenges Faced:
ðŸ”¸ Ensuring data accuracy by handling incorrect joins and mismatched keys.
ðŸ”¸ Optimizing query performance for large datasets.
ðŸ”¸ Transforming date formats to analyze trends correctly.

ðŸ“Š Impact & Insights:
ðŸ”¹ Helped businesses identify their most valuable customers.
ðŸ”¹ Improved cash flow visibility by tracking pending payments.
ðŸ”¹ Provided a data-driven approach to manage inventory effectively.
ðŸ”¹ Enabled sales teams to focus on high-demand products.

This project deepened my SQL expertise in joins, aggregate functions, subqueries, and data transformation techniques. ðŸš€

Would love to connect with fellow data enthusiasts! Letâ€™s discuss how SQL-driven insights can transform business decisions. ðŸ’¬
